     Sparse Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis with Bayesian Model Reduction

 SPPCAX is a Python implementation of sparse probabilistic principal component
 analysis (SPPCA) using Bayesian model reduction and coordinate ascent
 variational inference. This method provides an efficient way to perform
 dimensionality reduction while automatically determining the optimal number of
 components and encouraging sparsity in the loading matrix.
